# Processing the Bill of Materials for SAP System Installation

## Prerequisites

- Deployer has been provisioned
- SAP Library has been provisioned and populated
- System Infrastructure has been provisioned from the Deployer
- The [SAP System configuration has been defined](./system-definition.md)

## Process

1. Log on to the Deployer VM, and navigate to the `ansible_config_files` directory in your SAP System directory, e.g.

   ```shell
   cd ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment/WORKSPACES/SAP_SYSTEM/<SAP_System_Deployment_Folder>/ansible_config_files
   ```

   Where `SAP_System_Deployment_Folder` is the System being deployed, e.g. `NP-CEUS-SAP0-X00`.

1. Run Ansible playbook which processes the BoM file to obtain and prepare the correct Installation Media for the system, and makes it available on the SCS node. Also exports the required fileshares for other nodes to install from.

   :warning: If you are running this as part of the template preparation (the templates do not yet exist), use:

   ```shell
   ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml --extra-vars "download_templates=false" ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment/sap-hana/deploy/ansible/playbook_process_bom.yml
   ```

   :warning: If you are running this as part of the deployment (the templates have been created and uploaded to the storage account), use:

   ```shell
   ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml ~/Azure_SAP_Automated_Deployment/sap-hana/deploy/ansible/playbook_process_bom.yml
   ```

   This playbook:

   1. Configures LVM volumes
   1. Configures generic SAP filesystem mounts
      1. Configures directory structure (e.g. `/sapmnt`, `/usr/sap`, etc.)
      1. Configures file systems (i.e. `/etc/fstab`)
   1. Configures install directories (e.g. `/sapmnt/<SID>` and `/usr/sap/install`)
   1. Iterates over BoM content to download (media, unattended install templates, etc.)
   1. **Note:** Nested BoMs will also be iterated over, to ensure media which may be needed for the installation will also be downloaded and made available.
   1. Downloads the Installation Media to a known location (`/usr/sap/install`) on the filesystem of a particular VM (SCS) and organised into directories where it benefits the automated process
   1. Creates NFS export of downloaded/extracted media making available to other VMs in the system
